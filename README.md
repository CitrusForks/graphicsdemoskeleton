Playground for DirectX 11 / 12 simple graphics demo examples ...

If anyone from Microsoft reads this: C99 support is broken in DirectX 12 ... look for GetCPUDescriptorHandleForHeapStart() in the examples.

These examples are "one single-file" programs that show the simplest possible way to program DirectX 11 and 12 without
caring about production quality code ...
The idea is that these examples can be used as a starting point in graphics demo competitions. The size of the exes is kept low.
