Playground for DirectX 11 / 12 simple graphics demo examples ...

If anyone from Microsoft reads this: C99 support is broken in DirectX 12 ... look for GetCPUDescriptorHandleForHeapStart() in the examples.

These examples are "one single-file" programs that show the simplest possible way to program DirectX 11 and 12 without
caring about production quality code ...
The idea is that these examples can be used as a starting point in graphics demo competitions. The size of the exes is kept low.

Another useful reference to understand this code:
Il semble que la perfection soit atteinte non quand il n'y a plus rien à ajouter, mais quand il n'y a plus rien à retrancher.
As translated by Lewis Galantière: ... perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away ...
